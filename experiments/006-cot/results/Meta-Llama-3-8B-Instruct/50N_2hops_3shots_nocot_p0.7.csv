","Let's analyze the statements:

1. Grom is a tumpus.
2. Tumpuses are impuses.
3. Impuses are not tall.
4. Grom is a lempus.

From statement 1, we know Grom is a tumpus.
From statement 2, we know tumpuses are impuses, so Grom is an impus.
From statement 3, we know impuses are not tall, so Grom is not tall.

However, statement 4 says Grom is a lempus, and lempuses are tall (from previous questions). This contradicts the previous conclusion that Grom is not tall.

So, we need to re-evaluate the statements. Since Grom is a lempus, and lempuses are tall, we can conclude that:

Grom is tall.

From the statements, we know:

* Wumpuses are luminous (Statement 4)
* Impuses are rompuses (Statement 7)
* Jinx is an impus (Statement 8)

Since Impuses are rompuses, and Wumpuses are luminous, we can conclude that Rompuses are luminous (by transitivity).
