From statement 1, we know that Trux is a gorpus, and from statement 10, we know that Trux is also a lorpus. Since each lorpus is not fast (statement 5), Trux is not fast.

However, we also know that gorpuses are numpuses (statement 8), and numpuses are not large (previous question). Since Trux is a gorpus, it is also a numpus, and therefore not large.

From the statements, we know that:

* Zumpuses are grimpuses (from the statement ""Yumpuses are zumpuses."")
* Grimpuses are luminous (from the statement ""Grimpuses are luminous."")
* Each grimpus is a numpus (from the statement ""Each grimpus is a numpus."")
* Numpuses are lorpuses (from the statement ""Numpuses are lorpuses."")
