Think step by step.
","Here's the answer:

(1) Grom is a numpus.
(2) Numpuses are not happy.
(3) Grom is not happy.

However, we also know that:

(1) Each vumpus is a zumpus.
(2) Each vumpus is happy.
(3) Grom is a vumpus (since Grom is a zumpus and each zumpus is a vumpus).

So, we have a contradiction: Grom is both not happy (as a numpus) and happy (as a vumpus). This means that the initial assumption that Grom is a numpus is incorrect.

Therefore, we can conclude that Grom is actually a vumpus, not a numpus.
