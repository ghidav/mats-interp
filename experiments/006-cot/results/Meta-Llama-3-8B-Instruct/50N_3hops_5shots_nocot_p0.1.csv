","I'll answer the question based on the given statements.

From the statements, we know:

* Each impus is a gorpus.
* Grom is a brimpus.
* Each brimpus is a dumpus.
* Each dumpus is a lorpus.
* Each lorpus is a shumpus.
* Each shumpus is a gorpus.
* Grom is a shumpus.

So, Grom is a gorpus, and each gorpus is a brimpus. Since Grom is a brimpus, and each brimpus is a dumpus, Grom is a dumpus. Since each dumpus is a lorpus, Grom is a lorpus. Since each lorpus is a shumpus, Grom is a shumpus. Since each shumpus is a gorpus, Grom is a gorpus.

Now, from the statements, we know:

* Each impus is a gorpus.
* Grom is a gorpus.

So, Grom is an impus, and each impus is crazy. Therefore, Grom is crazy.
