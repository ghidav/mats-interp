Question: Is Grom happy?
Answer Yes or No.
","I'll answer the question based on the given statements.

From the statements, we know that:

* Zumpuses are happy.
* Grom is a numpus.
* Numpuses are gorpuses.
* Gorpuses are heavy.

Since Grom is a numpus, and numpuses are gorpuses, Grom is a gorpus. And since gorpuses are heavy, Grom is heavy.

However, there is no statement that directly says Grom is happy. But since Zumpuses are happy, and Grom is a lorpus (from the statement ""Grom is a lorpus""), and Lorpuses are Zumpuses (from the statement ""Lorpuses are zumpuses""), Grom is a Zumpus. Therefore, Grom is happy.
