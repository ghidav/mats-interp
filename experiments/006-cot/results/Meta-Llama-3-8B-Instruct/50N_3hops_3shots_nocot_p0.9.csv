* Jinx is a gorpus (Q4) and a zumpus (Q4), and gorpus is a numpus (Q2), which are heavy (Q2).

Now, let's analyze the new question:

* Wumpuses are lorpuses (Q5), and lorpuses are luminous (Q5), but that's not relevant to the question.
* Jinx is a rompus (Q5) and a wumpus (Q5), and rompus is a sterpus (Q5), which is heavy (Q5).
