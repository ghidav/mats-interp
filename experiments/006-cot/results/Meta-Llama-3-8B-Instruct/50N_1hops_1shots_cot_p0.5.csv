Question: Is Grom hungry?
Think step by step.
","Let's break it down step by step:

(1) Grom is a shumpus.
(2) Shumpuses are hungry.
(3) Grom is a shumpus, so Grom is hungry.

However, we also know that:

(4) Each rompus is not hungry.
(5) Rompuses are tumpuses.
(6) Grom is a tumpus.

Since Grom is a tumpus, and tumpuses are rompuses, we can conclude that:

(7) Grom is a rompus.
(8) Each rompus is not hungry.

Now we have a contradiction: Grom is a shumpus and is hungry (from step 2), but Grom is also a rompus and is not hungry (from step 8). This means that our initial assumption that Grom is a shumpus must be incorrect.
